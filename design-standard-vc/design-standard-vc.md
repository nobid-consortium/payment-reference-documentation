# Standard VC flows "as is"

Note: I'm purposely using the VC terminology here because it's "as is" description.

Flows:

* [Verifiable Credential Issuance (aka Registration of Attestation to Pay)](./vc-issuance/flow-vc-issuance.md)  
* [Verifiable Presentation (aka Payment)](./vc-presentation/flow-vc-presentation.md)
